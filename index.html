                <p> <span class="hello">Hello! </span> <br> <br> My name is Gergő Farkas and I'm a hungarian webdeveloper. <br>
                    I started to learn programming at the high school. <br>
                    At the beginning I learned the basics in C++. <br>
                    After the basics I learned webprogramming with HTML, CSS and PHP. <br>
                    That was the time when I realized programming is cool, so I started to create some mini projects by myself at home. <br>
                    In the college I have had many programming classes including mobile app development and webdevelopment. <br>
                    During my college years I got familiar with Java and Javascript, however I prefer to do things in Javascript. <br>
                    Nowadays I usually use Javascript for everything, so I imagine myself as a javascript developer. <br>

                <h4>Webshop</h4>
                <p> <br> Before you look at this project, I would like to let you know, this is my very first project.<br>
                I know I should refactor it, but I want to track my progress in Javascript, so I really don't want to touch it. <br>
                In the near future, with the knowledge I have already acquired, I will create another webshop based on this project. <br> 
                I was very happy to be able to put this project together on my own. <br>
                During creating this "webshop", I learned to use google to solve my problems and filter the information. <br>
                Moreover I have tried to develop the basics of programming in Javascript to a higher level (though that wasn't always the case).

                <b> Programming languages </b> that I used in this project: <b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (vanilla)</b> <br><br>

                <h4>Memory Game</h4>
                <p> <br> This is a simple memory game with pictures. <br>
                    I used Web API in this project for random pictures. <br>
                    The link to this API: <a href="https://picsum.photos/" target="__blank">https://picsum.photos/</a> <br>
                    I will try to make a little effort soon to get the UX done nicely, but here the main goal was to use ES6 features such as async, await and also callback functions.<br>
                    I also coded this project by myself without any help, no lines were copied.

                <h4>Weather app</h4>
                <p> <br> This is my very first React project. <br>
                    I know a lot of weather applications have been done before me, but I chose to move API fetch and ES6 + technologies to another project. <br>
                    Coding in React and JSX is extremely enjoyable for me. <br>
                    While coding this project, I have figured out, that my next project will be also in React. <br>
                    The popular API I used in the project is: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="__blank">https://openweathermap.org/api</a> <br><br>
